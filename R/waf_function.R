#' Prediction of wind adjustment factor for sheltered and unsheltered fuels.
#' @usage waf(fuelDepth, forestHt, cr, cc, sheltered = "n")
#' @param fuelDepth a numeric vector of surface fuel bed depths (cm)
#' @param forestHt a numeric vector of average stand tree heights (m)
#' @param cr a numeric vector of crown ratios (\%)
#' @param cc a numeric vector of canopy cover (\%)
#' @param sheltered a character vector of either \code{"y"} or \code{"n"} (default) to use sheltered or not (unsheltered) equations
#' @details This calculates the wind adjustment factor (ratio of 20-ft open wind speed to wind speed at mid-surface flame height).
#' One of two equations are used, depending on user input: by default, this function assumes the surface fuel bed is unsheltered.
#' \code{fuelDepth} must be a positive value if the unsheletered variant is invoked.
#' \code{forestHt} must be a positive value if the sheletered variant is invoked.
#' There are two conditions to enable calculation for a sheltered fuelbed. First, if \code{cr} and
#' \code{cc} are entered and lead lead to a crown fill portion (CF) above 5\%, where , or the user could enter \code{"y"} for sheltered fuels. In the latter
#' case, this function assumes a crown fill portion of 10\%.
#' @return a vector of wind adjustment factors
